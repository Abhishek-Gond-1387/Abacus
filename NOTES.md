# Abacus learning notes

## Environment

- Python: 3.15.2
- Virtual environment: `.venv`

## Learned

- Small functions are easier to check when their input and edge-case behavior are clear.
- `pathlib.Path` keeps file paths independent of the terminal's current directory.
- JSON round-trips preserve structured data; UTF-8 keeps non-ASCII text readable.

## Confusing

- The `py` launcher is unavailable here; use the working `python` command.
- `largest([])` has no natural largest value, so this exercise raises `ValueError`.

## Next

- Day 4 completed: staged named files, reviewed the staged diff, and created the first local commit.
- Day 5: make a first API call only after configuring credentials outside source code.
