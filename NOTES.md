# Abacus learning notes

## Environment

- Python: 3.15.2
- Virtual environment: `.venv`

## Learned

- Small functions are easier to check when their input and edge-case behavior are clear.
- `pathlib.Path` keeps file paths independent of the terminal's current directory.
- JSON round-trips preserve structured data; UTF-8 keeps non-ASCII text readable.

## Confusing

- The `py` launcher is unavailable here; use the working `python` command.
- `largest([])` has no natural largest value, so this exercise raises `ValueError`.

## Next

- Day 4 completed: staged named files, reviewed the staged diff, and created the first local commit.
- Day 21 review completed; Day 22: define the allowed final outcomes in code.

## Day 21 review

Fixed edge cases and Hypothesis both exposed the duplicate-removal bug in the sorting seed and the incorrect result for all-negative inputs in the largest-value seed. Fixed cases made the boundary rationale visible; Hypothesis explored contract-valid lists and reduced its failing examples. Both sources used the same contract and trusted reference for each seed.

The offline LLM-style proposals found neither seeded bug: they proposed a sorted list without duplicates and a positive-only list. The invalid string and empty-list proposals were rejected as OUT_OF_CONTRACT before target execution. This shows why proposals need an independent checker; these fixtures were drafted for this review and did not come from a provider API.
